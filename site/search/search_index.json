By default, mavlink-router is configured to push telemetry via UDP to <code>10.223.1.10:14550</code></p> <p>Should you need or want to install this independently, EchoMAV has an open-source installer which makes it easy to install MAVLink Router and configure it as a service which starts at boot. Please refer to the our installer repo https://github.com/EchoMAV/mavlink-router for instructions. </p> <p>If you use the install repo above, please refer to the instructions there for configuration of the UART and destination IP address.
