## Vibration Isolation

When used in high-g or high-vibration environments, we recommend the use of vibration-damping mounts, consisting of McMaster Carr parts [93849A202](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/130/3678/93849A202) (washer) and [60525K21](https://www.mcmaster.com/catalog/130/1691/60525K21) (vibration-damping mount).
