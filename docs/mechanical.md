## Mounting and Vibration Isolation

The EchoTherm module can be mounted directly using the four M1.6 screws, or it can be mounted by clamping on the lens assembly. In all applications, take care to isolate the EchoTherm from high shock or vibrations, as this could lead to dead pixels or premature part failure.
