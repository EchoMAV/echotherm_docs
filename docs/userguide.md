## Accessing the Jetson console

!!! WARNING

    Do not run the Jetson SOM without a heat sink. The lid of the EchoTherm system is the primary heat sink, and running the Jetson with the lid off may result in shut down or throttling. If you need to run the system for a continued period of time with the lid removed, position a fan to move air over the heat spreader installed on the Jetson module.

Open the lid of the EchoTherm system, to expose the inner electronics.

!!! note

    A thermal pad is positioned between a heat spreader on the Jetson and the EchoTherm system lid. Please ensure this is in position and undamaged after removing and replacing the lid.

Attach a USB cable between your host computer and J15 (Console) on the EchoPilot AI Board. A USB-C right angle adapter may be useful. Such adapters are included with the hardware or can be obtained [elsewhere](https://a.co/d/0i08W69A).

In step 2, your host computer should have enumerated a virtual comm port. You will now need to find the name of the port.
!!! info
    **On Windows:** Open Device Manager (Start → Control Panel → Hardware and Sound → Device Manager) Look in the Device Manager list, open the category "Ports", and note the COM port added **USB Serial Port (COM?)** (e.g., COM10).  
    **On Linux:** Run ```dmesg -w``` and then plug in unplug and replug in the USB cable. You should see the name of the device added, typically ```FTDI USB Serial device converter now attached to ttyUSB?``` (e.g., ttyUSB0). 
Use a terminal program to connect to the Jetson's console at 115200 baud, 8N1. 
!!! info
    **On Windows:** We recommend [Putty](https://www.putty.org/) or [TeraTerm](https://teratermproject.github.io/index-en.html).  
    **On Linux:** We recommend Picocom. Install with ```sudo apt-get install picocom```. Use with ```picocom /dev/ttyUSB? -b 115200```. To exit picocom, use ```Ctrl-a Ctrl-x```.
Power the EchoTherm System 13-36VDC source capable of supplying up to **4A**.
!!! warning
    If using a bench supply with over-current protection, we recommend turning it **OFF**. The boot process requires short bursts of high current and over-current protection on some supplies will result in a failed boot. In most cases, if the Jetson fails to boot it is due to a poor power supply.
You should now see the boot messages in your console, and once boot is complete, you will see a login prompt.
!!! note
    The default username is **echopilot** and the default password is **echopilot**
!!! success
    At this point you are logged into the Jetson.

## Accessing the Jetson via network

The EchoTherm system has two 100Mbps Ethernet ports (ETH1 and ETH2). Upstream, these go to a network switch, so either one can be used to access the Jetson SOM. An M12 to RJ45 cable is required (e.g. [ASI-M12-RJ45-11101](https://www.digikey.com/en/products/detail/asi-ez/ASI-M12-RJ45-11101/14008395?s=N4IgTCBcDaIIIGUCSBaAsgRjCgSgKQBYBWFDMgBgwB0AXEAXQF8g))

EchoMAV's standard provisioning sets the Jetson module to a static IP address provided on the label with the device. There is also an alias ip of 192.168.253.0 which can be used if you do not know the static IP. 

To gain console access to the Jetson over the network, use `ssh` from a terminal session on the host computer:

```
ssh echopilot@IP_ADDRESS    #IP_ADDRESS obtained from the label on the device
```
!!! note
    The default password is **echopilot**


!!! note
    If the label is damaged, or the static IP has been inadvertently changes, you can use the configuration IP "backdoor" alias of __192.168.154.0/24__ to access the system. Ensure your host system is in the 192.168.0.0/24 subnet (any valid IP address __not equal__ to 192.168.154.0 will work). Please refer to the instructions above for how to change your host IP address.

## IP Configuration

__The EchoPilot AI will be labeled from the factory with a static IP address in the 10.223.0.0/16 subnet such as 10.223.134.126 (for example only). If you do not know the IP address, you may be able to access the system using the backdoor/alias IP of 192.168.154.0/24__. 

During provisioning, the system's static IP address is calculated using the last two octets of the Jetson's `eth0` interface MAC address with a netmask of 255.255.0.0 (/16). For example, given the MAC address of 00:30:1A:4E:A4:3E, the last two octets 0xA4 and 0x3E are converted from hex to decimal and then assigned as the last two octets of the IP address. In this example, this MAC address would correspond to 10.223.164.62/16 because 0xA4 = 164 and 0x3E = 62. This IP address is printed on the label from the factory.

### Changing the IP Address

To change the Jetson's IP address, first [gain console access](userguide.md#accessing-the-jetson-console) via USB (internally in the box), then follow the steps below to change the configuration to either DHCP or a different static IP address. Making these changes when connected to the Jetson over the network will likely result in you losing your connection as the Ethernet interface goes up/down.

### Configuring for DHCP

If you wish to use [DHCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol), follow the instructions below:

Once logged in via the console, modify the existing static connection (e.g. "static-eth0") to be DHCP:
```
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.method auto
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.gateway ""
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.address ""
sudo nmcli con down static-eth0
sudo nmcli con up static-eth0
```
If the network connection is plugged into a DHCP server, the system will now get an IP address. You can confirm with: 
```
ip addr
```

### Configuring or Changing the Static IP Address

If you do not have a DHCP server, or you wish to assign a static IP address to the Jetson, follow the instructions below.

First [gain console access](userguide.md#accessing-the-jetson-console) via the USB connector. Once logged in via the console, delete the default connection, for example "Wired connection 1":
```
sudo nmcli c delete "Wired connection 1"
```
Set up a static connection called `static-eth0` with an IP of 10.223.1.10, a netmask of 255.255.0.0 and a gateway of 10.223.1.1. The values are just examples, please adjust to the desired settings for your network.
``` 
sudo nmcli c add con-name static-eth0 ifname eth0 type ethernet ip4 10.223.1.10/16 gw4 10.223.1.1
```
Bring up the new interface
```
sudo nmcli c up static-eth0
```
To verify network connectivity, ping another device on the network, or to verify internet connectivity, ping a Google DNS server:
```
ping 8.8.8.8
```

### Other NetworkManager tips and tricks
Linux for Tegra uses networkmanager (`nmcli`) for its network interfaces. Below you will find a few commands for common network tasks. These examples are not intended for you to follow sequentially, these are common examples which will demonstrate most network configuration needs.

Show connections:    
```nmcli con show```

Example: Delete the default connection ("Wired connection 1") and set up a static connection called `static-eth0` with an IP of 172.20.1.100, a netmask of 255.255.0.0 and a gateway of 172.20.2.100:    
```
sudo nmcli c delete "Wired connection 1"
sudo nmcli c add con-name static-eth0 ifname eth0 type ethernet ip4 172.20.1.20/16 gw4 172.20.2.100
sudo nmcli c up static-eth0
```

Example: Change IP address of `static-eth0` connection to `192.168.1.4` with a 255.255.0.0 (/16) netmask:    
```
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.address 192.168.1.1/16
```

Example: Change the gateway of `static-eth0` connection to `192.168.1.1`:    
```
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1
```

Example: Change the DNS of `static-eth0` connection to `8.8.8.8`:       
```
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8"
```

Example: Take down/up of `static-eth0`:      
```
sudo nmcli con down static-eth0
sudo nmcli con up static-eth0
```
Example: Delete the `static-eth0` connection:    
```
sudo nmcli c delete "static-eth0"
```

Example: Add a new connection called `static-eth0` with IP `172.20.2.22/16` and gateway `172.20.2.100` on interface `eth0`:    
```
sudo nmcli c add con-name static-eth0 ifname eth0 type ethernet ip4 172.20.2.22/16 gw4 172.20.2.100
```

Example: Add a persistent route so that multicast traffic to 224.x.x.x goes to the `static-eth0` connection:  
```
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 +ipv4.routes "224.0.0.0/8"
```

Example: Change the static-eth0 connection to remove static IP and enable DHCP. In this case, it would be clearer to delete the connection since it is named `static-eth0` and call it something else, but for edification:
```
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.address ""
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.gateway ""
sudo nmcli con mod static-eth0 ipv4.method auto
sudo nmcli con reload static-eth0
```

## Connecting to the FMU via the USB connector

1. Attach a USB cable between the host computer and the **FMU USB** connector (J7).
2. Start a Ground Control application on the host computer such as [QGroundControl](https://docs.qgroundcontrol.com/master/en/getting_started/download_and_install.html) or [Mission Planner](https://ardupilot.org/planner/docs/mission-planner-installation.html).
!!! info
    **QGroundControl:** Will automatically connect.  
    **Mission Planner:** Select the appropriate COM port at the top right, 115200, then click CONNECT.

## Cellular Modem Installation

The EchoTherm system is compatible with Sierra Wireless M.2 3052 modems, such as the EM9191. Using other modems may not work without configuration changes due to the way other modems detect the presence of SIM cards and other critical functionality. 

When installing a cellular modem, care must be provided to also install the heat sink kit. This kit works by placing a thermal bad under the modem, which couples heat to a copper pour on the EchoTherm carrier board. On the top side of the EchoTherm carrier board, a heat sink is placed using thermal conductive epoxy. Failure to properly heat sink the Cellular modem may result in throttling, especially during data uploads (such as video streaming).
